## Introduction

Function pointers are pointers that store the addresses of functions instead of data variables. They provide a mechanism to dynamically choose and call functions at runtime, which is particularly useful in scenarios where the choice of the function to be executed is not known until the program is running.

This repository aims to demonstrate the basic concepts of function pointers, provide practical examples, and explore their applications in C programming.

## Getting Started

To get started with the examples in this repository, ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system. You can use popular compilers like GCC or Clang. Clone this repository and navigate to the desired example to explore the code and concepts.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x0F-C-Function-Pointers.git
cd 0x0F-C-Function-Pointers/example-1
gcc example.c -o example
./example
```

## Function Pointers Basics

In this section, we'll cover the fundamental concepts of function pointers. Topics will include:
- Declaring and initializing function pointers
- Calling functions using function pointers
- Assigning functions to function pointers

## Passing Function Pointers as Arguments

In this section, we'll explore how to pass function pointers as arguments to other functions. We'll see how this technique allows us to implement generic functions that can work with different behaviors based on the function pointer provided.

## Using Function Pointers with Structs

Function pointers can be used in conjunction with structs to create powerful data structures. We'll demonstrate how to store function pointers inside structs and leverage them to implement a rudimentary form of polymorphism.

## Advanced Concepts

Once we have a solid understanding of the basics, we'll dive into more advanced topics. This includes:
- Array of function pointers
- Function pointers to functions with different signatures
- Callback functions

## Conclusion

In this section, we'll summarize the key takeaways from our exploration of function pointers. We'll emphasize their strengths, where they are most useful, and best practices for using them in C programming.

## References

We'll list the references used in this repository and suggest additional resources for those who want to dive deeper into function pointers and related topics.
