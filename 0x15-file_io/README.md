# ALX Project: 0x15. C - File I/O

Welcome to the ALX project "0x15. C - File I/O" README! This project focuses on the essential concepts of File Input/Output (I/O) in the C programming language. File I/O is crucial for interacting with files on the system, allowing you to read data from and write data to files. This project will help you understand how to work with files in C and perform operations like reading, writing, and manipulating file contents.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will delve into the world of File I/O through various tasks and challenges. You will learn how to:

- Open files using the `open()` function with different access modes.
- Use file descriptors to interact with files.
- Read data from files using functions like `read()`.
- Write data to files using functions like `write()`.
- Close files properly using the `close()` function.
- Perform more advanced operations like copying files, using file permissions, and more.

## Getting Started

To start working on the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd 0x15-file_io`
3. Read the instructions for each task in the respective task files (e.g., `0-read_textfile.c`, `1-create_file.c`, etc.).
4. Implement your solutions in the provided C files. Feel free to create new files if needed.
5. Compile your C programs using the appropriate compiler command.
6. Test your programs against the provided test cases to ensure correctness.

## Tasks

The project is organized into tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of File I/O. Some of the tasks you will encounter include:

1. **Read Text File**: Create a function that reads and prints the contents of a text file to the standard output.
2. **Create File**: Write a function that creates a file and fills it with a given text content.
3. **Append to File**: Implement a function that appends text content to an existing file.
4. **CP Command**: Create a program similar to the `cp` command, which copies the content of one file to another.
5. **POSIX Permissions**: Write a program to change the permissions of a file using POSIX functions.

## Resources

During this project, you can use various resources to help you:

- Man pages for system calls and functions (e.g., `man open`, `man read`, `man write`, etc.).
- Online tutorials and guides on C File I/O.
- ALX mentors and peers for guidance and support.

## Conclusion

By completing the tasks in this project, you will gain a strong understanding of File I/O in C, an essential skill for any programmer working on systems programming, data processing, or file manipulation. Good luck, and enjoy your journey into the world of C File I/O in the ALX project "0x15. C - File I/O"!
