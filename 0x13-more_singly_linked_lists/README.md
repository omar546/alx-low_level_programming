# 0x13. C - More singly linked lists

## Overview

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate various operations on singly linked lists. It is a continuation of the previous repository titled "0x12. C - Singly linked lists." In this repository, we delve deeper into singly linked lists, exploring additional operations and solving more complex problems using these data structures.

## List of Programs

1. **0-print_listint.c**: This program prints all the elements of a singly linked list containing integers.

2. **1-listint_len.c**: This program calculates the number of elements in a singly linked list containing integers.

3. **2-add_nodeint.c**: This program adds a new node at the beginning of a singly linked list containing integers.

4. **3-add_nodeint_end.c**: This program adds a new node at the end of a singly linked list containing integers.

5. **4-free_listint.c**: This program frees the memory allocated for a singly linked list containing integers.

6. **5-free_listint2.c**: This program frees the memory allocated for a singly linked list containing integers and sets the head to NULL.

7. **6-pop_listint.c**: This program deletes the head node of a singly linked list containing integers and returns the head node's data.

8. **7-get_nodeint.c**: This program returns the nth node of a singly linked list containing integers.

9. **8-sum_listint.c**: This program calculates the sum of all the data (integers) stored in a singly linked list.

10. **9-insert_nodeint.c**: This program inserts a new node at a given position in a singly linked list containing integers.

11. **10-delete_nodeint.c**: This program deletes the node at a given position in a singly linked list containing integers.

<!-- 12. **100-reverse_listint.c**: This program reverses a singly linked list containing integers.

13. **101-print_listint_safe.c**: This program prints a singly linked list containing integers and handles loops in the list safely.

14. **102-free_listint_safe.c**: This program frees a singly linked list containing integers, even if it has loops.

15. **103-find_loop.c**: This program finds the loop in a singly linked list containing integers and returns the address of the first node in the loop. -->

## How to Use

To compile and run any of the above programs, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Navigate to the desired program's directory:

```
cd <program_directory>
```

3. Compile the program using GCC or any C compiler:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <program_name.c> -o <output_executable_name>
```

4. Execute the compiled program:

```
./<output_executable_name>
```
