# 0x12. C - Singly linked lists

## Overview

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate the implementation and manipulation of singly linked lists. A singly linked list is a data structure that consists of nodes, where each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence.

## Files

The repository contains the following main files:

1. **lists.h**: This header file contains the necessary function prototypes used in the linked list implementation.

2. **0-print_list.c**: This file contains a function that prints all the elements of a singly linked list.

3. **1-list_len.c**: This file contains a function that returns the number of elements in a singly linked list.

4. **2-add_node.c**: This file contains a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a singly linked list.

5. **3-add_node_end.c**: This file contains a function that adds a new node at the end of a singly linked list.

6. **4-free_list.c**: This file contains a function that frees the memory allocated for a singly linked list.

## Getting Started

To run the programs, make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC). You can clone this repository and navigate to the desired program's directory to compile and execute it.

Here's an example of how to compile and run the `0-print_list.c` program:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic 0-print_list.c -o print_list
./print_list
```

## Usage

These programs serve as examples of how to work with singly linked lists in C. You can use them as a reference to understand the basic concepts of linked lists, such as traversal, insertion, and memory management.

Feel free to modify the programs or include them in your own projects as needed.

## Contributing

If you find any issues with the code or have improvements to suggest, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions are welcome!

## Credits

The programs in this repository were written as part of the Holberton School curriculum (0x12. C - Singly linked lists project).
